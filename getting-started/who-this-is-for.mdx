# Who This Framework Is For

DNA Framework is designed for **builders who care about systems**.

Not everyone needs this framework. Not every company will benefit from it. Here's how to know if it's right for you.

## ✅ You Should Use DNA If...

### You're Experiencing Growing Pains

Your team used to move fast and stay aligned. Now:
- Decisions take longer
- Teams contradict each other
- New hires are confused
- You're repeating the same debates
- "That's not how we do it" becomes common

**DNA helps you scale without losing coherence.**

---

### You're About to Scale

You're at 10-30 people and planning to grow. You want to avoid the fragmentation you know is coming.

**DNA lets you encode alignment before you lose it.**

---

### You're Building in Public or with AI

Your company is designed to be:
- Transparent and documented
- AI-integrated from day one
- Operated with clear systems

**DNA makes your company legible to both humans and machines.**

---

### You're Post-Pivot or Post-Merge

You've recently:
- Changed direction
- Acquired another company
- Merged teams
- Rebranded

**DNA helps you rebuild coherence across the new reality.**

---

### You Value Systems Over Heroics

You believe:
- Good systems beat individual genius
- Clarity beats charisma
- Structure enables creativity
- Constraints are liberating

**DNA is systems thinking applied to company building.**

---

## ❌ You Shouldn't Use DNA If...

### You're Pre-Product

You're still figuring out what you're building. You don't have product-market fit. You're experimenting rapidly.

**Wait until you have something worth encoding.** DNA works best when you have patterns to capture—not when you're still searching for them.

---

### You're Not Willing to Maintain It

DNA isn't a one-time exercise. It requires:
- Quarterly reviews
- Active editing
- Team buy-in
- Leadership commitment

**If you won't maintain it, don't start it.** A stale DNA is worse than no DNA.

---

### You Prefer Intuition Over Structure

You believe:
- "Good people will figure it out"
- "We don't need to document everything"
- "Process kills creativity"
- "Our culture is our secret sauce"

**DNA probably isn't for you.** This framework is about making implicit patterns explicit.

---

### You're Looking for a Quick Fix

DNA takes time to build. You'll see benefits quickly, but full value comes from:
- Thoughtful mapping
- Team participation
- Iterative refinement

**If you want instant results, look elsewhere.**

---

## Who's Already Using DNA?

### Startups (5-50 people)
Using DNA to scale without fragmenting. Encoding their early decisions before tribal knowledge gets lost.

### Scale-Ups (50-200 people)
Using DNA to rebuild alignment after growing too fast. Systematizing what used to be intuitive.

### Product-Led Companies
Using DNA to maintain product coherence across multiple teams and features.

### AI-First Companies
Using DNA to define how AI integrates across all systems—not as a feature, but as infrastructure.

### Remote-First Companies
Using DNA as the shared context that replaces hallway conversations and osmotic knowledge transfer.

## The DNA Mindset

This framework works best for people who believe:

1. **Companies are systems**, not just collections of people
2. **Clarity is a competitive advantage**
3. **Good constraints enable better creativity**
4. **Alignment is structural, not cultural**
5. **Documentation should be alive, not dead**

If you read those and thought "yes, exactly"—this framework is for you.

## Still Not Sure?

Ask yourself:

> "If I left my company tomorrow, would someone be able to make decisions the way I would?"

If the answer is no, you need DNA.
