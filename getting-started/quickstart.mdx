#Quickstart — Your First 10 Minutes
Welcome to the fastest onboarding you’ll ever do.

In the next **10 minutes**, you will create your company’s **first DNA folder**, map your **first weak strand**, and feel why this framework eliminates internal chaos.

You don’t need a team.  
You don’t need meetings.  
You only need clarity — right now.

---

## 🟣 Step 1 — Create Your `DNA/` Folder

Create a folder in your project, repo, or workspace:

```bash
mkdir DNA


Inside it, create the initial structure:

touch DNA/company-dna.md
touch DNA/brand.md
touch DNA/product.md
touch DNA/tech.md
touch DNA/operations.md

<Callout type="info"> You are not creating documentation. You are building the internal operating system of your company. </Callout>
🟣 Step 2 — Define Your Core DNA Sentence (3 minutes)

Open company-dna.md.

Add one sentence answering:

“What core behavior must never break in this company?”

Examples:

“We ship fast and learn faster.”

“We simplify complexity for customers.”

“We protect trust above everything else.”

“We design with empathy and build with precision.”

This becomes your Primary Gene — the anchor every decision inherits from.

🟣 Step 3 — Identify Your Weakest Strand (1 minute)

Review the 12 strands:

Brand

Product

UI

UX

Tech

Data

Conversation

Operations

Sales

AI

Security

Team

Pick the one you already know is failing you.
This is where alignment collapses first.

<Callout type="warning"> Your weakest strand accounts for **80% of internal entropy**. </Callout>
🟣 Step 4 — Create a “Strand Snapshot”

Open the MD file of the weak strand (example: operations.md).

Paste:

## Snapshot
What currently works:
- (Add 1 line)

What consistently breaks:
- (Add 1 line)

Biggest pain this causes:
- (Add 1 line)

If we fix only ONE thing in this strand, it should be:
- (Add 1 line)


This gives you immediate X-ray vision of the problem.

🟣 Step 5 — Add Your First Gene (2 minutes)

A Gene = a rule, behavior, or decision that prevents chaos.

Add this section:

## Genes
- Gene #1: (Add the behavior that would eliminate the pain above)


Examples:

Ops Gene: “No release goes live without a 3-step checklist.”

Sales Gene: “We only sell what we can deliver within 30 days.”

Tech Gene: “Every feature has a single owner — never shared.”

UX Gene: “Every flow must remove one user step.”

One gene already reduces entropy.

🟣 Step 6 — Add Your First Sequence (90 seconds)

A Sequence = a repeatable process encoded as steps.

Add:

## Sequence
Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3


Example:

## Sequence
Support ticket → Categorize → Assign owner → Close feedback loop


You now have:

1 Snapshot

1 Gene

1 Sequence

This is enough to start aligning your team tomorrow.

🟣 Step 7 — Link It Back to Your Core DNA (30 seconds)

Open company-dna.md again and add:

### Why this strand matters right now
This weak strand breaks our core DNA because: <1 sentence>


This creates alignment — the heart of the entire system.

🎉 You Just Installed the DNA Framework

In 10 minutes you completed the full loop:

Created your DNA skeleton

Defined your Core DNA

Found your weakest strand

Mapped it

Added your first gene

Added your first sequence

Linked it to your company identity

This is the foundation of a low-entropy, high-clarity organization.
