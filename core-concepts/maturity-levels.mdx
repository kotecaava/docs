# DNA Maturity Levels (1–5)

Companies evolve through **five stages of DNA maturity**.

Each stage represents how explicitly your operating system is encoded and how actively it shapes behavior.

---

## Level 1: Chaos

### Characteristics
- **No shared rules.** Every decision is a debate.
- **No documentation.** Everything is verbal.
- **Inconsistent patterns.** Everyone does things differently.
- **High founder involvement.** Every decision escalates.

### What It Looks Like
- "Should this button be primary or secondary?" → 30-minute discussion
- "How do we write error messages?" → No one knows
- "What's our pricing strategy?" → Founder decides case-by-case
- New hires: "How do we do X?" → "Ask around"

### Why Companies Stay Here
- **Too early.** Pre-product-market fit, everything changes daily.
- **Too busy.** "We'll document later" (spoiler: they won't).
- **Anti-process.** "Documentation kills creativity."

### Problems at This Level
- Slow decisions (everything requires discussion)
- Inconsistent output (no shared standards)
- Knowledge loss (when someone leaves, patterns leave)
- Scaling impossibility (can't grow past 10-15 people)

### Signals You're Here
- ❌ No written rules
- ❌ Repeated debates on same questions
- ❌ "That's not how we do it" without documentation
- ❌ Onboarding takes weeks

---

## Level 2: Tribal

### Characteristics
- **Rules exist in people's heads.** Implicit patterns emerge.
- **Tribal knowledge.** "Just ask Sarah, she knows."
- **Works through osmosis.** New people pick it up over time.
- **Fragile.** When Sarah leaves, knowledge leaves.

### What It Looks Like
- Patterns exist: "We usually do it this way"
- But unwritten: Nothing documented
- Enforced socially: "That's not how we do things here"
- Knowledge transfer: Shadowing, Slack DMs, tribal learning

### Why Companies Stay Here
- **Feels efficient.** "Everyone knows how things work."
- **Low overhead.** No docs to maintain.
- **Comfortable.** Works as long as team is stable.

### Problems at This Level
- Knowledge siloing (locked in specific people)
- Turnover devastation (departures create knowledge gaps)
- Inconsistency at scale (tribal knowledge doesn't transfer)
- Slow onboarding (new hires learn through trial and error)

### Signals You're Here
- ✅ Consistent patterns exist
- ❌ Not written down
- ❌ Depends on specific people
- ❌ New hires confused for months

**Most companies are stuck at Level 2.**

---

## Level 3: Documented

### Characteristics
- **Rules are written down.** Wiki, Notion, Google Docs.
- **But disconnected.** Isolated documents, not a system.
- **Rarely referenced.** Docs exist but aren't used.
- **Quickly outdated.** Written once, never updated.

### What It Looks Like
- "Check the wiki" (but nobody does)
- Docs cover some areas, not others
- No clear structure (scattered across tools)
- Writing docs feels like busywork

### Why Companies Stay Here
- **Documentation theater.** Feels productive to write docs.
- **No adoption.** Team doesn't use what's written.
- **Maintenance burden.** Docs decay immediately.

### Problems at This Level
- Docs diverge from reality (outdated quickly)
- Low usage (team ignores documentation)
- Discovery problem (can't find relevant docs)
- Still requires tribal knowledge (docs don't cover real scenarios)

### Signals You're Here
- ✅ Documentation exists
- ❌ Nobody reads it
- ❌ Not connected to daily work
- ❌ Feels like compliance, not tool

**This is where good intentions go to die.**

---

## Level 4: Systematic

### Characteristics
- **DNA is live, connected, and referenced daily.**
- **Genes shape decisions.** "Check the gene, apply the rule."
- **Strands are well-defined.** Clear structure.
- **Sequences documented.** Workflows are explicit.

### What It Looks Like
- Designer: "Should this be a modal?" → Checks UX.Navigation gene → Decision made in 30 seconds
- Engineer: "What API format?" → Checks Tech.APIFormat gene → Implements correctly
- New hire: "How do we hire?" → Reads Team strand → Understands process
- Quarterly review: DNA is updated, versioned, communicated

### Why Companies Get Here
- **Intentional investment.** Leadership commits to building DNA.
- **Team adoption.** DNA becomes part of daily workflow.
- **Maintenance culture.** DNA is kept current.

### Benefits at This Level
- Fast decisions (genes eliminate debate)
- Consistency (everyone follows same rules)
- Scalable onboarding (DNA is the training system)
- Visible dependencies (sequences show connections)
- Intentional evolution (changes are versioned)

### Signals You're Here
- ✅ DNA referenced in daily work
- ✅ New hires read DNA first
- ✅ Genes answer 80% of questions
- ✅ Quarterly reviews happen
- ✅ Sequences prevent silo problems

**This is the target for most companies.**

---

## Level 5: Evolved

### Characteristics
- **DNA shapes decisions automatically.**
- **Alignment is structural, not aspirational.**
- **AI integrated.** AI agents read and apply DNA.
- **Self-maintaining.** Team updates DNA as part of work.
- **Culture = encoded genes.** Values manifest as rules.

### What It Looks Like
- Decisions happen without DNA lookup (internalized)
- AI tools reference DNA (Cursor reads Tech genes, applies patterns)
- Pull request reviewers check DNA compliance automatically
- New features designed DNA-first (check constraints before building)
- Pivots planned as DNA migrations (versioned, intentional)

### Why Few Companies Get Here
- **Requires Level 4 maturity first.** Can't skip steps.
- **Needs tool integration.** AI + automation.
- **Demands maintenance discipline.** DNA must stay current.

### Benefits at This Level
- Near-zero decision overhead (rules are internalized)
- Perfect consistency (AI enforces patterns)
- Instant onboarding (AI guides new hires through DNA)
- Pivot capability (DNA rewriting is a known process)
- Company = legible system (fully documented, AI-readable)

### Signals You're Here
- ✅ AI reads and applies your DNA
- ✅ DNA internalized by team (automatic reference)
- ✅ Genes updated continuously (part of workflow)
- ✅ Zero fragmentation (structural alignment)
- ✅ New hires productive in days, not months

**This is the aspirational state.**

## Maturity Assessment

### Where is your company?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Level 1: Chaos">
    - No written rules
    - Every decision debated
    - Onboarding through trial-and-error

    **Action:** Start with 3 strands, 10-15 genes total
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Level 2: Tribal">
    - Patterns exist, not documented
    - Knowledge locked in people's heads
    - Turnover causes knowledge loss

    **Action:** Extract tribal knowledge into genes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Level 3: Documented">
    - Docs exist, rarely used
    - Disconnected from daily work
    - Quickly outdated

    **Action:** Restructure as strands + genes, integrate into workflow
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Level 4: Systematic">
    - DNA referenced daily
    - Genes guide decisions
    - Sequences prevent silos

    **Action:** Expand to all 12 strands, automate checks
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Level 5: Evolved">
    - DNA internalized
    - AI integrated
    - Structural alignment

    **Action:** Maintain ruthlessly, evolve intentionally
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Maturity Progression

You can't skip levels. **You must progress sequentially.**

```
Level 1 → Level 2: Patterns emerge organically (6-12 months)
Level 2 → Level 3: Extract and document patterns (1-2 months)
Level 3 → Level 4: Make DNA live and active (3-6 months)
Level 4 → Level 5: Internalize and automate (6-12 months)
```

**Total time to Level 4: ~12-18 months of intentional work**

---

## What Level Should You Target?

### Level 4 is the goal for most companies

**Level 1-2:** Acceptable only if you're &lt;10 people and pre-PMF
**Level 3:** Dangerous. Feels like progress, but creates false security.
**Level 4:** Target state. DNA is functional, active, valuable.
**Level 5:** Aspirational. Requires significant investment.

---

## Common Failure Modes

### Skipping to Level 3 Without Level 2
Writing docs before patterns exist → Docs are useless

### Staying at Level 3
Docs exist but not used → Wasted effort, team ignores them

### Building Level 4 DNA But Not Maintaining It
DNA decays back to Level 3 → Worse than not building it

---

## The Level 4 Threshold

**Getting to Level 4 is the unlock.**

Before Level 4:
- Decisions are slow
- Alignment is fragile
- Scaling is hard

After Level 4:
- Decisions are fast
- Alignment is structural
- Scaling is possible

**Level 4 is where DNA becomes a competitive advantage.**
