# Inheritance, Conflict & Constraints

DNA isn't static. It **evolves**.

But evolution isn't random—it follows rules. This page explains the physics of how your company's DNA changes and self-organizes.

---

## Inheritance: How Genes Extend

**Inheritance** is when a new gene builds on an existing one.

### Example: Color Hierarchy

```yaml
Parent Gene: Brand.ColorPrimary
Rule: Brand color is #0066FF (blue)

Child Gene: UI.InteractiveColor
Rule: Interactive elements use Brand.ColorPrimary
Inherits: Brand.ColorPrimary

Grandchild Gene: UI.HoverState
Rule: Hover states darken by 10%
Inherits: UI.InteractiveColor
Calculation: darken(Brand.ColorPrimary, 10%)
```

**When Brand.ColorPrimary changes, all descendants automatically update.**

---

### Why Inheritance Matters

Without inheritance:
- Change brand color
- Manually update 47 places
- Miss 3 of them
- Product feels inconsistent

With inheritance:
- Change brand color (one gene)
- All descendants update automatically
- Zero manual work
- Perfect consistency

## Conflict: When Genes Contradict

Sometimes genes contradict each other. **This is not a bug—it's information.**

Conflicts reveal hidden tensions that need resolution.

### Example: Speed vs. Security

```yaml
Gene: Operations.ShipFast
Rule: Ship features within 2-week sprints
Priority: High velocity

Gene: Security.ReviewRequired
Rule: All code changes require security review (3-5 days)
Priority: Zero vulnerabilities

Conflict: Security review timeline exceeds sprint length
```

**What do you do?**

---

### Conflict Resolution Strategies

#### 1. **Prioritization**
Decide which gene wins.

```yaml
Resolution: Security.ReviewRequired takes precedence
Outcome: Sprints adjusted to 3-week cycles
Rationale: Security breach costs > slower shipping
```

#### 2. **Synthesis**
Create a new gene that satisfies both.

```yaml
New Gene: Security.FastTrackReview
Rule: Security reviews prioritized for sprint-critical features
  - Daily review slots reserved
  - 2-day SLA for P0 features
  - 5-day SLA for P1 features
Satisfies: Both speed and security needs
```

#### 3. **Context-Dependent**
Both genes apply in different contexts.

```yaml
Resolution: Context-based priority
  - Customer-facing features: Security.ReviewRequired wins
  - Internal tools: Operations.ShipFast wins
Outcome: Split review process by risk level
```

#### 4. **Deprecation**
One gene is outdated.

```yaml
Resolution: Deprecate Operations.ShipFast
Reason: Company maturity, can't sacrifice security anymore
New Gene: Operations.BalancedShipping (includes security in timeline)
```

---

### Conflict as Signal

**Conflicts are valuable.**

They show:
- Where your company is growing
- Where old assumptions no longer fit
- Where implicit values need to become explicit

**Don't avoid conflicts. Resolve them explicitly.**

---

## Constraints: How Genes Limit Each Other

**Constraints** are when one gene restricts possibilities for another.

This isn't conflict—it's physics. Some genes naturally limit others.

### Example: Tech Constrains UI

```yaml
Gene: Tech.ResponsiveFramework
Rule: All UI must be mobile-responsive
Constraint on: UI Strand

Impact on UI:
  - Can't use: Fixed-width layouts
  - Can't use: Hover-only interactions
  - Must use: Touch-friendly hit targets (min 44px)
  - Must use: Fluid typography
```

**Tech gene creates boundaries that UI genes must respect.**

---

### Common Constraint Patterns

#### Tech → UI/UX
```yaml
Tech.Browser Support
  Constrains: UI.Animations (no advanced CSS)
  Constrains: UX.Features (no WebRTC on old browsers)

Tech.Performance Budget
  Constrains: UI.ImageSize (max 200kb)
  Constrains: UX.VideoAutoplay (not on mobile)
```

#### Brand → Product
```yaml
Brand.Positioning ("Premium, not cheap")
  Constrains: Product.PricingStrategy (no low-end tier)
  Constrains: Product.FeatureScope (no "good enough" features)
```

#### Security → Data
```yaml
Security.Compliance (GDPR, HIPAA)
  Constrains: Data.Storage (encrypted at rest)
  Constrains: Data.Retention (delete after 90 days)
  Constrains: Data.Access (audit logs required)
```

#### Product → AI
```yaml
Product.UserControl ("Users always in control")
  Constrains: AI.Autonomy (AI suggests, never decides)
  Constrains: AI.Automation (user approval required)
```

---

### Why Constraints Are Good

Constraints:
- **Prevent bad decisions** before they happen
- **Clarify boundaries** between systems
- **Force creativity** within limits
- **Make dependencies visible**

**Constraints are not limitations—they're guardrails.**

---

## The Constraint Graph

Your DNA forms a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** of constraints.

```
Brand ─→ Product ─→ UX ─→ UI
  ↓         ↓        ↓     ↓
  └────→ Sales    Tech    Data
            ↓        ↓     ↓
         Operations ← AI ← Security
```

**Arrows = "constrains"**

This graph shows:
- Which genes depend on which
- What order to make decisions
- Which changes will ripple through the system

---

## Constraint Conflicts

Sometimes constraints form impossible situations.

### Example: Impossible Triangle

```yaml
Gene: Product.FeatureRichness
Rule: Build comprehensive features, not MVPs

Gene: Tech.FastShipping
Rule: Ship features in 1-week cycles

Gene: Team.SmallTeams
Rule: Keep engineering teams at 3-5 people

Conflict: Can't build comprehensive features + ship weekly + stay small
```

**This is real tension that needs resolution.**

Options:
1. Relax Product.FeatureRichness (ship MVPs)
2. Extend Tech.FastShipping (2-week cycles)
3. Grow Team.SmallTeams (hire more engineers)
4. Reduce Product.FeatureScope (build less)

**The constraint conflict forces an explicit strategic decision.**

## Evolution: How DNA Changes Over Time

DNA evolves through four mechanisms:

### 1. **Mutation** (Gene Change)
A gene changes because context changed.

```yaml
Old Gene: Brand.Voice
Rule: Playful, casual, use emojis

New Gene: Brand.Voice (v2)
Rule: Professional, clear, no emojis
Reason: Target market shifted from consumers to enterprise
```

### 2. **Insertion** (New Gene)
A new gene is added.

```yaml
New Gene: AI.TransparencyRequirement
Rule: All AI-generated content must be labeled
Context: Regulatory requirement introduced
Impact: Affects Conversation, Product, UI strands
```

### 3. **Deletion** (Gene Removal)
A gene becomes obsolete.

```yaml
Deleted Gene: Tech.IE11Support
Reason: <0.1% of users, maintenance burden too high
Date Deprecated: Q1 2024
Date Removed: Q2 2024
```

### 4. **Recombination** (Strand Reorganization)
Genes move between strands.

```yaml
Gene: ConversationTone
Old Strand: Brand
New Strand: Conversation (newly created)
Reason: Conversation became its own system as AI expanded
```

---

## DNA Versioning

Every change to DNA should be versioned.

```yaml
Company DNA v2.3.0
Date: 2024-03-15

Changes:
- [BREAKING] Brand.Voice updated (removed emojis)
- [NEW] AI.TransparencyRequirement added
- [DEPRECATED] Tech.IE11Support (removed in v2.4.0)
- [FIXED] UI.ButtonHierarchy clarified (max 1 primary button)

Migration Guide:
- Update all marketing copy to remove emojis
- Add AI labels to product UI
- Remove IE11 polyfills in next release
```

**Versioning lets you:**
- Track changes over time
- Communicate updates to the team
- Roll back if needed
- Understand why decisions were made

---

## The Self-Organization Property

Here's the magic:

**When DNA is explicit, companies start self-organizing.**

- Engineers check Tech genes before building
- Designers reference UI genes before designing
- Product checks constraints before proposing features
- Sales applies Brand genes when talking to customers

**You don't need to be in every meeting.**

The DNA guides decisions.

---

## The DNA Equation

```
Alignment = (Explicit Genes × Active Constraints) / Entropy
```

More explicit genes → more alignment
More active constraints → fewer bad decisions
Less entropy → more coherence

**DNA increases the numerator and decreases the denominator.**
