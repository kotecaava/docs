# 🧱 UI Strand – Slack

_Visual patterns · Components · Design systems_

The **UI Strand** describes how the product looks and behaves on screen:\
layouts, patterns, components, and the design system that keeps everything consistent.

Here we use **Slack** as a concrete, fact-based example, based on its public brand guidelines, product UI, and Block Kit documentation.

---

## 🧬 1. UI System Overview

<info>
  Slack effectively runs on two tightly connected systems:

  1. A brand system (logo, colors, typography, illustration)
  2. A product UI system (app layout, patterns, Block Kit components)
</info>

### Brand vs. Product UI

- Brand palette: expressive, vibrant colors (aubergine, blue, green, yellow, red, black, white) used for marketing and identity.
- Product UI: more muted, accessible, low-fatigue colors that still echo the brand but prioritize usability and legibility over visual noise.

### Block Kit – App UI Framework

For apps and extensions **inside Slack**, the UI framework is:

- **Block Kit** – a stackable UI framework for messages, Home tabs, and modals.
- Built from:
  - **Blocks** – structural chunks (sections, images, actions, context, etc.).
  - **Block elements** – interactive components (buttons, selects, date pickers, etc.).
  - **Composition objects** – smaller building blocks like text objects and options.
- Used for:
  - App messages
  - App Home surfaces
  - Modals / forms
  - Rich notifications and interactive flows

---

## 🧩 2. Structural Building Blocks

### Core Layout Surfaces in Slack

Slack's main product UI is organized around a small set of **reusable layout surfaces**:

- **Workspace Shell**
  - Top app bar with workspace switcher, search, and quick actions.
- **Navigation Sidebar**
  - Channels, direct messages, sections, and key views (e.g. Activity, Later, etc. depending on version).
- **Main Content Pane**
  - Message timelines, threads, huddles, canvases, and app content.
- **Secondary Panels**
  - Thread details, profiles, canvas details, app drawers that slide in from the right.
- **Global Overlays**
  - Modals, dialogs, pickers (channel picker, time picker, file upload, etc.).

### Block Kit Surfaces

For apps and workflows, Block Kit defines specific **surfaces**:

- **Messages**
  - Rich, interactive messages in channels and DMs, built from up to a defined limit of blocks.
- **Modals**
  - Structured dialogs for forms, confirmations, and multi-step workflows.
- **App Home**
  - A customizable "app dashboard" inside Slack, composed completely of blocks.

Each surface type has **layout constraints** (max blocks, supported elements) that enforce consistency and prevent chaotic UI.

## 🧱 3. Block Kit Components & Patterns

<Card title="Blocks">
  High-level structural units like section, header, divider, image, actions, and context. They define the vertical flow and hierarchy of messages, modals, and app surfaces.
</Card>

<Card title="Block Elements">
  Interactive controls such as buttons, select menus, checkboxes, radio buttons, date pickers, and more. These live inside blocks and drive app interactivity.
</Card>

<Card title="Composition Objects">
  Smaller objects (like text objects, option objects, confirm dialogs) that consistently shape content and behavior across blocks.
</Card>

### Common UI Patterns Enabled by Block Kit

- **Action rows** – buttons and menus grouped in an `actions` block.
- **Card-like messages** – section + image + context blocks mimicking a card layout.
- **Forms in modals** – input elements stacked vertically with clear labels and helper text.
- **Dashboards in App Home** – repeated sections with metrics, filters, and actions.
- **Rich notifications** – compact messages with primary action buttons and secondary info.

## 🎨 4. Visual Language in the Product UI

### Color System in the App

Slack's product UI color usage follows a few core rules:

- **Neutral canvas** – grays and soft surfaces for main backgrounds to reduce fatigue.
- **Branded accents** – Slack colors (especially aubergine, blues, greens, yellows) used for:
  - highlights
  - buttons
  - badges / statuses
  - selection states
- **Semantic colors** – greens for "success", reds for "errors/alerts", yellows for "warnings", tuned for contrast and accessibility.

### Typography

Slack's visual identity uses:

- **Larsseit** and **Slack Circular** (or similar fallbacks) in marketing and product surfaces.
- Type roles:
  - Headlines / primary labels – bold, clean, and high-contrast.
  - Body copy / messages – highly legible at small sizes for long-form chat content.
  - Metadata / timestamps – de-emphasized but readable, often with lighter weight or smaller size.

### Iconography & Shape Language

- **Rounded shapes** – pill buttons, circular avatars, soft cards.
- **Octothorpe heritage** – the Slack logo and key UI metaphors reference the `#` symbol (channels, hashtags).
- **Simple, vector icons** – minimal, clear metaphors, optimized for small sizes and dense environments.

---

## 🧠 5. Interaction & State Patterns

Slack's UI patterns are built around **real-time, conversational work**:

### Interaction Principles

- **Inline First**
  - Most actions (reactions, replies, file previews) happen inline without leaving the channel.
- **Progressive Disclosure**
  - Threads, canvases, user profiles, and app details open in side panels or overlays instead of full page navigations.
- **Non-blocking Modals**
  - Forms and confirmations appear in modals with clear primary/secondary actions, and safe exits.

### State Handling

- **Read vs Unread**
  - Channels and messages use clear typographic and color cues (bold labels, badges) to signal unread activity.
- **Hover & Focus States**
  - Message rows and interactive elements show subtle hover/focus affordances to clarify click targets.
- **Error & Confirmation States**
  - Errors are communicated near the control that caused the issue, with clear, human-readable messaging.
- **Ephemeral vs Persistent**
  - Ephemeral messages and transient prompts are visually differentiated from persistent content.

---

## ♿ 6. Accessibility & Content Rules

Slack's UI and Block Kit guidelines emphasize:

### Content Rules

- **Clear and concise copy** – especially in buttons, labels, and block text.
- **Avoid over-loading blocks** – use hierarchy and whitespace so content is scannable.
- **Consistent wording** – reuse terminology and patterns across workflows.

### Accessibility Practices

- **Color contrast** – brand and UI colors are checked for accessible combinations in text and backgrounds.
- **Structured layouts** – blocks and elements are ordered logically for assistive technologies.
- **Descriptive labels** – interactive components have clear labels and alt text where needed.
- **Keyboard-friendly interactions** – modals and controls are designed to work without a mouse.
