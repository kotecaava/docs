# Operations Strand – The Internal Execution OS

**Your strategy is only as real as your operations.**

The **Operations Strand** defines **how the company actually works every day**:

- how people are coordinated,
- how work moves from idea to shipped,
- how incidents are handled,
- how vendors, security, finance, and people systems stay in sync.

If Product is _what_ you build and Tech is _how_ it runs,\
**_Operations is how it all moves together without chaos_**.

## 🎯 Purpose & Role – Why Operations Exists

**Guiding question**

> _Why does Operations exist?_

**Core answer**

Operations ensures the company runs **predictably, safely, and efficiently**.\
It coordinates **people, processes, tools, and decision structures** so the company can **scale without chaos**.

Operations is the **connective tissue** synchronizing:

- product,
- engineering,
- sales,
- customer success,
- finance,
- people,
- security.

**Objectives**

- Create processes that **scale with the company**, not against it.
- Remove friction from **cross-functional work**.
- Ensure **predictable shipping, reliability, and support**.
- Protect the company via **compliance, security, and risk management**.
- Maintain **operational clarity** as the org grows.

---

<info>
  Each Ops function is a **subsystem in the Execution OS**.\
  Clarity on **who owns what** prevents “everyone kind of owns it” — which means *no one* does.
</info>

---

## ⏰ Operational Rituals – The Cadence of the Company

**Weekly**

- Security review.
- Recruiting pipeline review.

**Quarterly**

- Company-wide OKR review.
- Planning for next quarter.
- Budget & resource allocation.

---

## 🤝 Cross-Functional Collaboration – How Work Actually Moves

**Guiding question**

> _How do teams collaborate effectively?_

### Systems

- Shared **Slack channels** for each initiative.
- Slack Connect for **external partners**.
- Asana / Jira for **project management**.
- Google Workspace for documents.
- Centralized **internal wiki** for knowledge.

### Rules

- **One owner** per initiative, many collaborators.
- Decisions documented in **Slack channels or internal wiki**.
- Cross-functional leads meet weekly during **high-impact launches**.
- **Slack-first communication** before meetings.

### Anti-patterns

- Multiple owners.
- Decision-making inside **private DMs**.
- Undocumented cross-team agreements.
- “Shadow” processes outside shared tools.

<warning>
  If decisions live in **DMs and people’s heads**,\
  you don’t have collaboration — you have **operational dark matter**.
</warning>

## 🚀 Execution Systems – How Ideas Become Shipped Reality

**Product development framework:**\
**Modified dual-track agile** – continuous discovery + continuous delivery.

### Core Tools

- Jira for engineering execution.
- Figma for design.
- Slack for alignment + async debate.
- GitHub for code reviews and version control.

### Stages of Work

1. Problem definition
2. Design exploration
3. Technical scoping
4. Implementation
5. Testing
6. Launch readiness
7. Release
8. Post-release monitoring

### Definition of Done

A change is only “done” when:

- Meets acceptance criteria.
- Passes **accessibility checks**.
- Docs are updated.
- Support is ready (macros, known issues).
- Logs + metrics **instrumented**.
- **Feature flags** exist.
- Incident alerting **configured**.

---

## 🚢 Release & Deployment – How Shipping Works

### Pipeline

1. **Commit → CI → Automated tests**.
2. Staging environment → QA.
3. **Gradual rollout via feature flags**.
4. Monitoring + rollback capability.
5. Full deployment after **stability confirmation**.

### Principles

- Small, **frequent releases** reduce risk.
- Feature flags for all **user-facing changes**.
- Automated tests prevent regressions.
- Rollback must be **instant and safe**.

### Responsibilities

- **Product**
  - Owns definition, acceptance criteria, launch messaging.
- **Engineering**
  - Owns quality, deployment, monitoring.
- **Support**
  - Prepared with macros, scripts, troubleshooting guides.

---

## 💬 Internal Communication – How Information Flows

### Channels

- Company-wide announcements channel.
- Team channels with **weekly summaries**.
- Project-specific channels.
- Docs in internal wiki.
- Async updates via **Slack canvases**.

### Principles

- Document decisions in **public channels**, not private chat.
- Over-communicate during **high-risk / high-impact** projects.
- **Summaries** over raw message floods.
- **Async-first** – meetings only when truly needed.

---

## 🚨 Incident Management – How You Handle “Oh Shit” Moments

### Incident Severity Levels

- **SEV0** — complete outage or security breach.
- **SEV1** — severe degradation.
- **SEV2** — functional but impaired.
- **SEV3** — minor impact.

### Response Process

1. On-call engineer **paged automatically**.
2. Incident **lead + scribe** assigned.
3. Dedicated Slack incident channel created.
4. Status page updated (if needed).
5. Customer communication via **predefined templates**.
6. Root-cause analysis within **48 hours**.

### Post-incident Practices

- **Blameless postmortems**.
- Actionable follow-up tasks.
- Engineering retro.
- Documentation updates.

<info>
  Incidents are **tuition payments** to reality.\
  The Operations Strand decides whether you **learn from them** or just **survive them**.
</info>
