# AI Strand – The Collaborative Intelligence Layer

**AI is not a feature — it’s the intelligence layer of your company.**

The **AI Strand** defines how your company:

- understands and summarizes information,
- augments search and discovery,
- automates workflows and decisions,
- powers agents that act on behalf of users,
- and does all of this **safely, explainably, and under governance**.

This is your **AI OS**: the blueprint for how intelligence is applied **everywhere** in the product.

## 🎯 Purpose & Role – Why AI Exists

**Guiding question**

> _Why does AI exist inside Slack?_

**Core answer**

AI **amplifies human work** by:

- summarizing information,
- accelerating search,
- automating repetitive tasks,
- understanding intent,
- enabling agents to interact with business systems on behalf of users.

AI transforms Slack from a **communication tool** into a **collaborative intelligence layer**.

**Objectives**

- Reduce cognitive load in **complex, high-velocity communication**.
- Surface the **right information at the right time**.
- Automate workflows that previously required **manual coordination**.
- Enable teams to work **asynchronously without losing context**.
- Let users interact with **enterprise systems via natural language**.

<info>
  If AI doesn’t clearly reduce cognitive load or manual work,\
  it’s decoration — not a strand.

## 🧩 How to Use This AI Strand in Practice

1. **Map current AI features**
   - List every place AI already appears (search, composer, workflows, bots).
   - Classify them into **use cases and surfaces** in this strand.
2. **Define your AI architecture + data rules**
   - Decide how models are selected,
   - what data they can see,
   - and where guardrails live.
3. **Connect AI to other strands**
   - For each Product, UX, Data, Support, and Sales initiative,
   - ask: _“What does the AI version of this look like?”_
4. **Instrument AI performance**
   - Track reliability, accuracy, adoption, and **business outcomes**.
   - Kill or rework AI that doesn’t move those needles.
5. **Codify human-AI collaboration**
   - Make override, feedback, and explainability **first-class UX**, not afterthoughts.
