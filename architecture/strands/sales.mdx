# Sales Strand – The Revenue Engine OS

**Sales isn’t about pressure — it’s about redesigning how your customer works.**

The **Sales Strand** defines how your company:

- targets and understands the right customers,
- frames the product in the language of outcomes,
- runs **PLG + enterprise motions** in sync,
- and turns conversations into **predictable, sustainable revenue**.

Think of it as the **Sales OS**: the mental model your revenue engine uses to **think and act**.

---
