  - Articles, guides, tutorials.
  - Single source of truth for **AI and human agents**.
- **Internal runbooks**
  - Step-by-step fixes for recurring issues:
    - auth problems,
    - integrations,
    - permissions,
    - environment quirks.
- **Tagging system**
  - Tag by **product area, severity, persona, device, integration**.

  If support is constantly rewriting the same answer,\
  your knowledge system — not your agents — is failing.

**Negative examples**

- “This is not our fault.”
- “You are using it wrong.”
- “We can’t help with that.”

## 📈 Escalation Paths – How Serious Issues Move

**Guiding question**

> _How do unresolved or serious issues escalate?_

### Escalation Steps

- **Tier 0 → Tier 1** if AI cannot confidently answer.
- **Tier 1 → Tier 2** for technical analysis or reproduction.
- **Tier 2 → Engineering** if likely a bug or backend issue.
- **Any tier → Security** if suspicious activity is detected.
- **Enterprise → CSM** if the relationship is at risk.

### Incident Response

- Support alerts **SRE or on-call engineer**.
- Issue logged in **incident tracker**.
- Customers updated during incident every **30–60 minutes**.
- Post-incident **RCA** shared with affected customers.

---

## 🔁 Feedback Loops – How Support Shapes the Product

**Guiding question**

> _How does support improve the product?_

### Loops

- Tag and categorize issues by **product area**.
- Weekly feedback sync with **product and engineering**.
- Support-led **“Top Issues”** report shared monthly.
- AI-generated clustering of **frequent tickets**.
- UX research reviews transcripts for **patterns**.

### Product Influence

- Bug prioritization.
- Feature improvements.
- Documentation updates.
- Onboarding enhancements.

<success>
  Support is your **highest-fidelity product analytics**.\
  If it doesn’t loop back into roadmap and UX, you’re wasting signal.
</success>

## 📊 Metrics & Reporting – How Support Is Measured

**Support Metrics**

- First response time.
- Full resolution time.
- AI resolution rate (Tier 0 success).
- Escalation rate (to Tier 2/3).
- Ticket backlog.
- Customer Satisfaction (**CSAT**).

**Experience Metrics**

- Effort score (how hard it was to get help).
- Reopened ticket rate.
- Time to first meaningful response (not just “we got your ticket”).
- Drop-off rate from self-serve to human channels.

---

## 🚨 Risk & Governance – How Support Can Fail (and How You Prevent It)

**Key Risks**

- Over-reliance on AI causing **incorrect or insensitive answers**.
- Missing or slow escalations for **critical incidents**.

- Inconsistent responses across agents and regions.
- Under-reporting of systemic issues to product and security.

**Guardrails**

- Clear policies on **when AI must hand off** to humans.
- Mandatory escalation rules for **security, billing, and data-loss issues**.
