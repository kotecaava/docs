# Data Strand – The Operating System of Your Company

**Your product doesn’t run on features — it runs on data.**

The **Data Strand** defines how your company:

- structures information,
- moves it across systems,
- secures and governs it,
- and turns it into **insights, AI, and automation**.

If the Tech Strand is the **nervous system**, the Data Strand is the **memory + intelligence layer** — it connects **every other strand** into one coherent operating system.

---

## 🧪 Workshop Meta – How to Design the Data Strand

**Framework version:** `data-strand-v1.0`

**Use this strand to map:**

- Data Purpose
- Data Domains & Entities
- Pipelines & Flows
- Storage & Architecture
- Access & Permissions
- Governance & Compliance
- Analytics & Insights
- AI & Automation
- Quality & Reliability
- Lifecycle & Retention
- Risks & Guardrails

**Who should be in the room**

- Data engineering
- Backend / platform engineering
- Product & UX
- Marketing / growth
- AI / ML

**Facilitation notes**

- Start by mapping **real events, logs, objects, and usage telemetry**, not abstractions.
- Treat this as the **Data OS** — the backbone that **every system and team** relies on.

---

## 🎯 Purpose & Role – Why This Company Collects Data

**Guiding question**

> _Why does this company collect and use data?_

**Core answer**

Data ensures the product stays **reliable, personalized, and secure**, enabling:

- fast search,
- AI-powered assistance,
- performance optimization,
- customer insight,
- and compliance.

Data is the **connective tissue** across strands:

- **Product** – feature usage, adoption, outcomes
- **UX** – flows, drop-offs, friction events
- **UI** – interaction events, clickstreams
- **Marketing** – attribution, cohorts, campaigns
- **AI** – summarization, retrieval, recommendations

**Primary objectives**

- Power **real-time collaboration, search, and AI summarization**.
- Maintain **workspace integrity, access control, and security**.
- Support **product-led growth, customer insights, and adoption metrics**.
- Fuel **automation** through telemetry and workflow triggers.

</warning>

---

## 🧱 Storage & Architecture – Where Data Lives

**Datastores and their jobs**

- **Relational DB**
  - **Use:** Users, orgs, channels, permissions, metadata
  - **Notes:** Strong consistency required for **identity and access**.
- **Object Storage**
  - **Use:** Files, media, canvas versions
  - **Notes:** Versioning, scanning, **encryption at rest**.
- **Search Clusters**
  - **Use:** Messages, threads, artifacts
  - **Notes:** Combines **keyword indexing** and **vector embeddings**.
- **Time-series DB**
  - **Use:** Metrics, telemetry, performance logs
  - **Notes:** Used by **SRE, reliability, and product analytics**.
- **Data Warehouse**
  - **Use:** Analytics, BI, dashboards, segmentation
  - **Notes:** **Source of truth** for user and workspace metrics.
- **Cache / KV Store**
  - **Use:** Presence, recent items, hot keys, ephemeral data

---

## 🔐 Access & Permissions – Who Sees What

**Guiding question**

> _Who has access to what data, and how is it enforced?_

**Principles**

- **Least privilege** by default.
- Role-based permissions for **org admins, owners, and users**.
- Clear separation between **internal staff, customers, and external partners**.
- **All access points audited.**

**Permission layers**

- Workspace-level permissions
- Channel membership
- Thread visibility
- Artifact-level permissions
- Admin override rules with **audit documentation**

---

## 🛡 Governance & Compliance – How Data Stays Legit

**Guiding question**

> _How do we ensure data is secure, compliant, and high-integrity?_

**Policies**

- Encryption **in transit and at rest**.
- Data residency options for **enterprise customers**.
- Retention settings configurable **per workspace**.
- Export tools for **compliance and eDiscovery**.
- Audit logs for all **critical actions**.

**Compliance frameworks**

- SOC 2
- ISO 27001
- GDPR
- HIPAA (if applicable)
- FedRAMP / GovCloud (for government workspaces)

<info>
  The Data Strand should explicitly document which frameworks you **target**,\
  which you’re **certified for**, and what that means for **product behaviour**.
</info>

---

## 📊 Analytics & Insights – What You Learn from Data

**Guiding question**

> _What metrics and insights are generated from data?_

### Product Metrics

- Daily Active Users
- Weekly Active Channels
- Messages sent per user
- Search usage
- Workflow Builder usage
- AI summary usage

### Experience Metrics

- Task completion time
- Flow drop-off
- Latency and error rates
- UX friction points from telemetry

### Business Metrics

- Retention and expansion
- Activation milestones
- Seat growth
- External collaboration adoption

### Marketing Metrics

- Attribution data
- Lifecycle segmentation
- Campaign performance
- Lead → conversion pipeline

---

## 🤖 AI & Automation – Turning Data into Leverage

**Guiding question**

> _How does data feed AI and automation systems?_

### AI Uses

- Summaries of **channels, threads, and canvases**
- Semantic search embeddings
- Decision extraction
- User preference prediction
- Workflow suggestions

### Automation Uses

- Triggers based on **message patterns**
- Workflow Builder events
- Bot interactions
- Cross-platform signals

### Responsible AI Policies

- AI never accesses content the user **can’t already access**.
- Summaries are **cached and revalidated** to avoid overprocessing.
- Models tested for **hallucination reduction**.
- Users get **consent and visibility** into AI operations.

---

## 📈 Quality & Reliability – Keeping Trust in the Data

**Quality dimensions**

- Latency (message post, render, search)
- Event delivery reliability
- Data correctness
- Search accuracy
- AI summary precision
- Zero data loss under scale

**Monitoring**

- Real-time dashboards for **ingestion and pipeline health**
- Anomaly detection on **message volume**
- Alerting rules for **indexing delays**

---

## 🕰 Lifecycle & Retention – How Data Ages

**Phases**

1. **Creation**
   - Messages, events, files, artifacts, telemetry
2. **Active use**
   - Displayed in UI, threads, search, canvases
3. **Archival**
   - Older content in **cheaper storage tiers**
4. **Deletion**
   - Retention-based or admin-initiated removals

**Principles**

- Users and admins **control visibility and retention**.
- Search respects **retention windows**.
- Deletion propagates to **all indexes and caches**.

---

## 🚧 Risks & Guardrails – How It Fails, How You Prevent It

**Risks**

- Data overload causing **slow search and degraded performance**.
- Inaccurate or outdated search indexes creating **trust issues**.
- AI summarizing **sensitive content incorrectly**.
- Broken workflows due to **missing telemetry**.

**Guardrails**

- **Strict pipeline ownership** per data domain.
- Automated **reindexing** for stale content.
- AI summaries **labeled** and easily toggled off.
- Rate limiting on ingestion systems under **overload**.

---

## 🧙‍♂️ Data Archetype – Who the System “Is”

**Guiding question**

> _If the data system were a role in the organization, who would it be?_

- **Primary archetype:** **Archivist**
- **Secondary archetype:** **Strategist**

**Rationale**

> The data system remembers everything, organizes it intelligently,\
> and provides the **insight and foresight** needed to make strategic decisions at scale.

---

## 📌 How to Use This Data Strand in Practice

1. **Run a cross-functional workshop**
   - Use this page as the **agenda**.
   - Fill in **your company’s answers** under each section.
2. **Map your real events and entities**
   - Start from **what actually exists**: logs, messages, files, telemetry.
   - Place everything into **domains and pipelines**.
3. **Decide storage and access patterns**
   - For each domain, decide:
     - where it lives (DB / warehouse / object store),
     - who can see it,
     - how long it lives.
4. **Wire analytics, AI, and automation explicitly**
   - For each metric or AI use case, map:
     - **source data → pipeline → model → UI surface**.
5. **Define risks & guardrails up front**
   - Decide how you detect failures,
   - and what should gracefully degrade when they happen.
