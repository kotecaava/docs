#  UX Strand – Experience System

UX is the layer that **turns product mechanics into human experience**.\
This strand defines how people understand the product, move through it, and feel while using it.

---

## 🧪 Workshop Meta

<note>
  Run this strand with **product, UX, UI, research, data, support and customer success** in the same room. Use it as the **UX operating system** — it should guide flows, copy, design reviews and iteration.
</note>

### Framework version

- `ux-strand-v1.0`

### Source templates in this strand

- UX Purpose & Role
- Experience Principles
- Personas & Contexts
- User Journeys
- Flows & Scenarios
- Information Architecture
- Content & Communication
- Error & Edge Cases
- Accessibility in UX
- Measurement & Feedback
- Governance & Rituals

### Facilitation notes

- Run with product, UX, UI, research, data, support and customer success.
- Anchor decisions in **real user behavior, sessions and tickets**, not opinions.
- Use this as the **UX operating system**: it should drive flows, copy and design reviews.

---

## 1. Purpose & Role of UX

**Question:**\
What is the role of UX in this product?

**Answer:**\
UX exists to make complex, collaborative work feel understandable, predictable and humane. It connects user needs to product behavior so people can focus on their work instead of fighting the tool.

### UX objectives

- Help users build a **clear mental model** of how the product works within their first sessions.
- Enable key workflows to be **discoverable, learnable and efficient across devices**.
- Support both **real-time and asynchronous collaboration** without overwhelming users.

---

## 2. Experience Principles

**Question:**\
Which principles should every experience, flow and screen follow?

### Core principles

1. **Clarity over cleverness**\
   Users should always know **where they are**, **what just happened** and **what they can do next**.
2. **Flow, not friction**\
   Interactions should help users stay in the **flow of their work**, avoiding unnecessary context switches.
3. **Conversation as a canvas**\
   Work is centred around conversations; UX should treat **threads, updates and async communication** as the backbone of workflows.
4. **Progressive depth**\
   Start simple, reveal complexity only when needed. Power users can go deep **without overwhelming newcomers**.
5. **Human tone and feedback**\
   Errors, confirmations and system messages should feel **human, respectful and actionable**.
6. **Async by default**\
   The experience should support **time-shifted work** so users don’t need to be online at the same time to stay aligned.

---

## 3. Personas & Contexts

**Question:**\
Who are we designing experiences for and in what contexts?

### Primary personas

#### Individual contributor

**Goals**

- Stay on top of relevant work **without drowning in notifications**.
- Find information and decisions quickly.
- Contribute updates and decisions with minimal overhead.

**Frustrations**

- Too many tools and channels to check.
- **Loss of context** when switching tasks or devices.

---

#### 👤 Team lead / manager

**Goals**

- Keep the team aligned **without micromanaging**.
- See the **status of projects at a glance**.
- Resolve issues and **unblock people quickly**.

**Frustrations**

- Needing to ask for updates repeatedly.
- Hidden work and decisions in **private channels or tools**.

---

#### 👤 Cross-functional collaborator

**Goals**

- Coordinate work with other teams or companies.
- Share updates and documents **in one place**.
- Understand how decisions affect their part of the work.

**Frustrations**

- Different tools and norms in each team.
- Missing context when **joining conversations late**.

---

### Usage contexts

- Deep focus work at a desk.
- Context-switching between meetings.
- Mobile catch-up while commuting or away from desk.
- Async collaboration across time zones.

---

## 4. User Research

**Question:**\
How do we ground UX decisions in real user insight?

### Methods

- Generative interviews with different roles and company sizes.
- Usability testing of key flows (remote and in-person).
- Diary studies or longitudinal studies for long-running projects.
- Analysis of support tickets and help center searches.
- Instrumentation and behavioral analytics of core flows.

### Cadence

- **Monthly** discovery sessions on upcoming themes.
- **Continuous** usability testing for in-flight designs.
- **Quarterly** “state of UX” review summarizing key findings.

### Research repository

- **Location:** `internal/research-repo`
- **Notes:** All insights tagged by persona, job-to-be-done, and product area to **reuse learnings across teams**.

---

## 5. Information Architecture

**Question:**\
How is information organized so users can build a stable mental model?

### Core structures

#### 5.1 Spaces / Workspaces / Orgs

- **Role:** Top-level boundaries for teams or companies.
- **Notes:** Users should always know which space they are operating in and **which people have access**.

#### 5.2 Channels / Topics / Rooms

- **Role:** Primary containers for thematic or team-based conversations and work.
- **Notes:** Each meaningful initiative, team or relationship gets its own **long-lived channel**.

#### 5.3 Threads / Sub-conversations

- **Role:** Focused discussions inside a larger stream.
- **Notes:** Threads prevent **timeline clutter** while keeping context attached to the origin.

#### 5.4 Artifacts (documents, lists, tasks, canvases)

- **Role:** Persistent content linked to conversations.
- **Notes:** Artifacts should be **easily discoverable from related conversations**.

---

### Navigation model

**Primary questions**

- Where do I go to pick up **the most important things for me**?
- Where do I put something so **others will find it later**?
- How do I know whether I’m seeing **everything relevant to my role**?

**Answers**

- **Home or main view** surfaces a prioritized mix of activity and focus.
- Clear guidance on **naming and structuring** spaces/channels/artifacts.
- **Filters and personalization** (muting, starring, sections) that keep IA flexible but coherent.

---

## 6. Flows & Scenarios

**Question:**\
What are the critical user flows and how are they shaped?

### 6.1 Onboarding & first-week experience

**Goal**\
Get new users to **basic proficiency and value quickly**.

**Key steps**

- Join workspace / space.
- Guided tour and “do this now” tasks.
- First message sent / reaction added.
- First channel joined and first search performed.
- Optional: set notifications and preferences.

**Success indicators**

- User completes a small set of guided actions.
- User understands differences between **spaces/channels/DMs**.
- User returns on **day 2 and day 7**.

---

### 6.2 Catch-up after time away

**Goal**\
Let users quickly understand **what changed while they were gone**.

**Key steps**

- Open workspace and see **prioritized summary of activity**.
- Review mentions, decisions, and key updates.
- Jump into relevant threads for deeper context.

**Success indicators**

- User can feel “caught up” in **minutes, not hours**.
- Reduced need to ask others “what did I miss?”.

---

### 6.3 Run a project in channels

**Goal**\
Coordinate cross-functional work with **clear accountability**.

**Key steps**

- Create or join project channel.
- Pin or link key artifacts (docs, lists, milestones).
- Share updates, decisions and blockers in a consistent format.
- Record decisions and outcomes where everyone can find them.

**Success indicators**

- Project updates are **visible and searchable** in one place.
- Stakeholders can see **status and next steps at a glance**.
- Decisions and outcomes are **documented in the channel**, not lost in DMs.

## 🔁 How to Use This Strand

- Treat this page as the **source of truth** for UX decisions.
- When debating flows, copy or IA, **point back to this strand**.
- Update it after major research rounds or product shifts so UX stays **alive and aligned** with reality.
