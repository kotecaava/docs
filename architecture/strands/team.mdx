# Team Strand – The People Operating System

**A company is not its product — it is its people.**

The **Team Strand** defines how your organization:

- manages performance and growth,
- designs collaboration patterns,
- and creates an environment where people do the **best work of their careers**.

This is your **Team OS** — the blueprint for how humans join, grow, collaborate, and succeed.
