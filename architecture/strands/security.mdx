# Security Strand – The Enterprise Trust OS

**If users don’t trust you, nothing else in your product matters.**

The **Security Strand** defines how your company:

- protects data at every layer,
- controls identity and access,
- secures apps and infrastructure,
- governs AI use,
- and responds to incidents with **speed and transparency**.

Think of this as your **Security OS** — the canonical blueprint used by engineering, product, operations, and AI.

  - engineering,
  - product,
  - AI/ML,
  - and operations.

## 🎯 Security Philosophy – How Slack Thinks About Security

**Guiding question**

> _What is Slack’s fundamental approach to security?_

**Core answer**

Security is designed as an **end-to-end system** combining:

- encryption,
- compliance,
- identity,
- monitoring,
- and operational rigor.

Slack follows a **Zero Trust model**, enforces **least privilege**, and embeds security into the **product lifecycle**.

Customer data is protected through:

- encryption,
- access controls,
- secure infrastructure,
- and continuous monitoring.

### Core Principles

- Security-by-design in every product decision.
- Least privilege access everywhere.
- Zero Trust networking and identity gating.
- Customer control over data visibility and administration.
- Transparency via clear logging and auditing of activity.
- Defense-in-depth across **every system layer**.

---

## 🔐 Data Protection – How Data Is Encrypted, Stored, and Retired

### Encryption

- **In transit**
  - TLS 1.2+ for all traffic between:
    - clients,
    - Slack servers,
    - and integrations.
- **At rest**
  - AWS KMS–backed **AES-256 encryption** for all stored data.
- **Enterprise Key Management (EKM)**
  - Customers can use their **own encryption keys**.
  - Capabilities:
    - Key revocation to immediately unread messages/files.
    - Granular per-channel key control.
    - Audit visibility via **EKM logs**.

---

### Data Residency

- Supported regions:
  - US
  - EU
  - UK
  - Japan
  - Australia
  - Canada
- Controls:
  - Admins can **pin default residency** for all workspace data.

---

### Data Lifecycle

- Configurable **retention policies per channel**.
- Message/file deletion rules.
- Customer-configurable **legal hold**.
- Controlled backups with **encrypted snapshots**.

---

## 🪪 Identity & Access – Who Gets In, and What They See

### Authentication

- SAML 2.0 SSO.
- SCIM provisioning.
- OAuth 2.0 for apps.
- Two-factor authentication (2FA).
- Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM).

### Authorization

- Granular roles:
  - Admin, Owner, Member, Guest.
- Channel-level access control.
- App permission scopes with **least privilege**.

### Zero Trust Layer

**Principles**

- Device posture checks for enterprise clients.
- Continuous authentication.
- Session invalidation on **suspicious activity**.

**Integrations**

- Okta.
- Azure AD.
- OneLogin.

<info>
  Security is not just **who you are**, but **where you are, what you’re using, and what you’re trying to do**.
</info>

---

## 🧱 Application Security – How the Product Itself Is Hardened

### Secure SDLC

- Threat modeling for new features.
- Security reviews for code changes.
- Static and dynamic code scanning.
- Red team testing.

### API Security

- Rate limiting.
- OAuth authorization layers.
- Signed requests for slash commands.
- Scoped bot tokens.

### App Review Process

- Marketplace apps go through **strict review**.
- Security testing of OAuth scopes.
- Verification of **data handling practices**.

---

## 🏗 Infrastructure Security – The Foundation

### Hosting

- Slack is hosted on **AWS** with multi-layered **network segmentation**.

### Controls

- Multi-tenant isolation.
- DDoS protection.
- Secrets management via **Hashicorp Vault**.
- Automated container patching.
- Continuous vulnerability scanning.

### Monitoring

- Real-time anomaly detection.
- SIEM alerts.
- Intrusion detection systems.
- Log analysis for **suspicious patterns**.

---

## 📜 Compliance & Certifications – Proof of Security Posture

### Certifications

- SOC 2 Type II.
- SOC 3.
- ISO 27001.
- ISO 27017.
- ISO 27018.
- FedRAMP Moderate.
- HIPAA.
- FINRA Compliance Support.

### Data Processing Agreements

- GDPR-compliant terms.
- CCPA data protections.
- Regional data privacy adherence.

### Enterprise Controls

- Admin audit logs.
- DLP (Data Loss Prevention) integrations.
- eDiscovery integrations.
- Legal hold enforcement.

---

## 🚨 Incident Response – When Things Go Wrong

**Guiding question**

> _How does Slack respond to security incidents?_

**Core answer**

Slack maintains a **24/7 incident response team**, runs **tabletop exercises**, leverages **automated detection systems**, and publishes **post-incident security reports** to impacted customers.

### Process

1. Detection.
2. Triage.
3. Containment.
4. Eradication.
5. Recovery.
6. Post-incident analysis.

### Customer Notifications

- Immediate outreach when **high-risk incidents** occur.
- Impact reports for **enterprise accounts**.
- Dedicated **Slack Connect channels** with enterprise security teams.

<warning>
  Security incidents are inevitable.\
  Security **cover-ups** are optional.
</warning>

---

## 🧭 Governance, Monitoring & Controls – The Control Plane

### Admin Controls

- Granular permissions for owners/admins.
- Session management and forced logouts.
- IP allowlists.
- Device restrictions.
- Ability to disable:
  - file uploads,
  - external sharing.

### Logging & Auditing

- User activity logs.
- Message access logs.
- App installation logs.
- Workflow execution logs.
- **AI feature usage logs**.

### Risk Management

- Continuous compliance automation.
- Vendor risk reviews.
- Penetration testing.
- Security awareness training for employees.

---

## 🤖 AI Security Layer – Security for the Intelligence Stack

### Model Safety

- AI models only process data users can **already access**.
- AI **cannot override** enterprise EKM encryption.
- AI decisions logged for **auditability**.

### Privacy Controls

- Admin toggle to enable/disable AI features.
- Workspace-level restrictions for **channel summaries**.
- No training on customer data without **explicit opt-in**.

### Safe Outputs

- Hallucination detection heuristics.
- Tone and factuality rules.
- AI suggestions clearly **labeled** for transparency.

<info>
  You don’t bolt security onto AI;\
  you extend your **existing Security OS** into the AI layer.
</info>

---

## 📱 Mobile & Device Security – Beyond the Desktop

### Controls

- Passcode enforcement.
- Device-level encryption.

- Patch deployment velocity.
- Pen-test score improvements.
- False positive rate on anomaly alerts.

### North Star

> **Be the most trusted enterprise collaboration platform in the world, with defensible, transparent, auditable security at every layer.**

---

## 🧙‍♂️ Security Archetype – Who Security “Is”

- **Primary archetype:** Guardian
- **Secondary archetype:** Architect

**Rationale**

> Slack security is protective, transparent, systematic, and anticipatory —\
> balancing **user freedom** with **enterprise-grade control**.

## 🧩 How to Use This Security Strand in Practice

1. **Map your current controls**
   - Encryption, identity, infra, app, AI, devices.
   - Identify where policy is **implicit** instead of written.
2. **Tie security into every strand**
   - Product, Tech, Data, AI, Operations, Sales.
   - Make security **invisible but ever-present** in their workflows.
3. **Codify incident + AI safety playbooks**
   - Response runbooks.
   - AI guardrails and escalation paths.
4. **Instrument maturity**
   - Track detection, containment, and patch speed.
   - Review security metrics like you review **revenue metrics**.
5. **Communicate trust**
   - Turn this strand into **externally shareable narratives**
   - for enterprise buyers, auditors, and regulators.
