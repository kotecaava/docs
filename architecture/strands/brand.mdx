# Slack Brand Strand 

We used Slack as an example for ease of understanding, since it’s a company we all know

_Your company’s identity, personality, voice, and meaning — demonstrated through Slack’s verified brand DNA._

This strand defines how the company shows up in the world:\
how it speaks, what it believes, the emotions it triggers, and the meaning it creates.

Slack is used here as a **real, verifiable case study**, based entirely on Slack's published brand guidelines and public artifacts.
