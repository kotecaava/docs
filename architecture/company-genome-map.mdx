description: "A single visual that shows how all strands, sequences, and genes of your company connect into one operating system."

_One picture of how your whole company actually works._

The **Company Genome Map** is the visual centerpiece of the DNA Framework.\
It’s a one-page diagram that shows:

- your core DNA,
- your 12 strands,
- their key sequences,
- and the most important interactions between them.

This page explains **what goes into the map**, **where visuals should appear**, and **how to read and use it**.

## 2. Legend (What Each Symbol Means)

```
[ COMPANY DNA ]   = The core identity / “what must never break”.
[ STRAND ]        = One of the core systems (Brand, Product, Tech, Ops, etc.).
[ Seq X ]         = A Sequence: a repeatable workflow that crosses strands.
● Gene            = A Gene: a specific rule, constraint, or behavior.
│ and ─           = Structural links (who belongs to what).
→ or ▼            = Direction of influence / flow.
```

---

## 3. Zooming In: Hierarchy as Symbols

### a) Top Level – DNA

```
[ COMPANY DNA ]
    "We ship fast and protect trust."
          │
          │  (everything below must be compatible with this sentence)
          ▼
```

The **Core DNA sentence** acts like gravity.\
Every strand, sequence, and gene must align with it.

---

### b) Strands – The 12 Core Systems

```
[Brand]   [Product]   [UI]   [UX]   [Tech]   [Data]
[Conv.]   [Ops]       [Sales][AI]   [Sec.]   [Team]
```

You can imagine them as a ring:

```
              [Brand]     [Product]     [UI]

        [Team]                               [UX]

        [Sec.]                               [Tech]

              [AI]       [Data]       [Conv.]

                  [Ops]          [Sales]
```

Each **[Strand]**:

- has its own rules (genes),
- owns some parts of sequences (steps),
- and is influenced by other strands.

---

### c) Sequences – How Work Actually Flows

Example: **“Ship a Feature”** sequence:

```
[Product] → [UX] → [UI] → [Tech] → [Ops] → [Conversation]
   │          │       │      │       │          │
   ●          ●       ●      ●       ●          ●
  Gene       Gene    Gene   Gene    Gene       Gene
("Define   ("Test   ("Use  ("Code  ("Deploy  ("Announce
 problem") prototype") design")  reviewed") safely")  feature")
```

Here:

- The **horizontal arrows** show the workflow.
- The **● genes under each step** define how that step must be done so it’s aligned with your DNA.

---

### d) Genes – The Atomic Rules

Inside each strand file you basically have:

```
[Strand: Ops]

  ● Gene: "No release goes live without a 3-step checklist."
  ● Gene: "Every incident gets a postmortem within 48 hours."
  ● Gene: "All customer-impacting changes are logged."

These ● genes attach to sequences:

  [Tech] → [Ops] → [Conversation]
           │   │
           ●   ●
```

Genes are the **smallest units of structure**.\
Change a gene → you change behavior → you change the strand → you change the whole DNA.

---

## 4. How Interactions Work (with Symbols)

### Inheritance (one strand influencing others)

```
[Brand]
   │  "We are radically transparent"
   │
   ├──────────→ [Conversation]
   │               ● Gene: "We never hide product limitations."
   │
   └──────────→ [Team]
                   ● Gene: "Leaders share context by default."
```

Brand **inherits into** Conversation and Team as concrete rules.

---

### Conflict (when two strands pull opposite ways)

```
[Sales]          ↔          [Product]
 "Close big deals"     vs   "Avoid custom one-offs"

      ▲                             ▲
      │                             │
      └────── conflict hotspot ─────┘
```

Here you might mark a **⚠ conflict symbol** in your map:

```
[Sales] ⚠ [Product]
```

---

### Constraint (one strand limiting another)

```
[Security] ──┬──|> constrains ───> [Product]
             │
             └──|> constrains ───> [Data]
```

Using `|>` or a lock 🔒 symbol:

```
[Security 🔒] ──|> [Product]
               └─|> [Data]
```

This reminds you:\
“Even if Product wants X, Security defines the safe boundary.”

## 5. The Structural Logic in One Formula

In symbols:

```
DNA = ( Strands → Sequences → Genes ) × Alignment
```

Where:

- **Strands** = [Brand] [Product] [Tech] …
- **Sequences** = flows like [Product] → [UX] → [Tech] → [Ops]
- **Genes** = ● rules sitting on those flows
- **Alignment** = how well all of the above respect the Core DNA sentence

High alignment ⇒ low entropy.
