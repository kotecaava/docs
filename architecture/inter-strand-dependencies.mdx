# **THE THREE IMMUTABLE LAWS OF THE STRANDS**

_written in a constitutional, biblical, almost sacred tone_

---

# The Immutable Laws of the Strands

_The constitutional backbone of the DNA Framework._

These laws are timeless.\
They are unchanging.\
They govern how every strand shapes, limits, and collides with another.\
Break them, and the company fractures.\
Honor them, and the company becomes unshakable.

## LAW I — The Law of Inheritance

> **That which is declared in one strand shall echo through all that depend on it.**

When a strand speaks a principle,\
when it defines a belief,\
when it sets a standard,\
its voice becomes the voice of every strand downstream.

No strand stands alone.\
Identity flows outward.\
Clarity begins at the source.\
Coherence is born through lineage.

**What the parent strand defines,the child strand becomes.**

## LAW II — The Law of Constraint

**“That which sets the boundary protects the whole.”**

Some strands hold authority not of expansion,\
but of limitation — sacred limitation.

They safeguard.\
They defend.\
They restrict so the system does not shatter.

Unbounded freedom is chaos.\
Constraint is protection.\
A boundary is a shield.

**Where a constraint is spoken,all other strands must obey.**

## LAW III — The Law of Friction

> Where two strands oppose, the truth of the system is revealed.

Friction is not failure.\
Friction is signal.

When two strands:

- seek incompatible outcomes,
- express opposing values,
- demand conflicting behaviors,

<Warning>
  the system reveals its fault line.
</Warning>

Misalignment spreads like fire.\
Friction is the spark.
